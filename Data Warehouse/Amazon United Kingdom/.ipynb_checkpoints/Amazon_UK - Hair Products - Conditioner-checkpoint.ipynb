And the tea tree extract, in this formulation, moisturizes dry hair, making it shinier and softer. Active Ingredients : Lemon Extract, Tea Tree Extract<CPT14>How is Lemon beneficial in fighting dandruff ? Extracted in its concentrated juice form, Lemon is nature's answer to dandruff. Being highly acidic in nature, lemon exfoliates excess oil on the scalp which houses the fungus and dirt. Stubborn dandruff can be treated well with a regular Lemon juice wash so as to keep the scalp clean and oil-free.<CPT14>Lemon juice is anti-bacterial in nature. This helps in preventing microbial activity on the scalp thereby preventing dandruff. Harsh chemicals, extreme temperatures and wind rip off the natural moisture from hair. Lemon helps in maintaining the pH balance of the scalp so as to keep it guarded against external stimuli.<CPT14>Rich in Vitamin C, Lemon Juice Extract keeps the scalp healthy and facilitates the proper regulation of oil by sebaceous glands, strengthening hair follicles and prevents hair fall and premature greying. Lemon extracts bring about that dazzling shine.<CPT14>Product is free from toxic chemical Free from Sulphate & Parben 100% Natural Product Made in India\n",
