Reducing packaging, recycling cardboard and wax are some of the ways in which we respect our environment and assist our consumers to best match their candles to their lifestyle.<CPT14>Suitable For: Nothing lifts the spirit and soothes the soul quite like the strong aroma derived from a plant's flowers, woods and fruits. Whether you want to ease stress, restore balance, ignite romance or encourage relaxation, our Green Mountain Collection is sure to provide you with what you need. Packaged in a big-size decorative travel tin, these candles are perfect for spas, massage, home use and luxury gifts. Citrus Harmony is a fragrant blend of orange, grapefruit and clove oils.\n",

Reducing packaging, recycling cardboard and wax are some of the ways in which we respect our environment and assist our consumers to best match their candles to their lifestyle.<CPT14>Suitable For: Nothing lifts the spirit and soothes the soul quite like the strong aroma derived from a plant's flowers, woods and fruits. Whether you want to ease stress, restore balance, ignite romance or encourage relaxation, our Green Mountain Collection is sure to provide you with what you need. Packaged in a decorative box, this glass candle jar is perfect for spas, massage, home use and luxury gifts. Citrus Harmony is a fragrant blend of orange, grapefruit and clove oils.\n",

The flowers are white or pale pink. Frankincense resin begins as a milky-white sticky liquid that flows from the trunk of the tree when it's cut, healing the wound. The resin is then distilled producing the precious oil.<CPT14>Aromatic Scent: Frankincense Essential Oil has a rich woody, earthy scent with a deeply mysterious nuance.<CPT14>History: Frankincense is widely known since biblical times. Frankincense is from the French word 'Franc' meaning 'luxuriant' or it could be 'real incense'.

      "Frankincense Essential Oil - 10ml - 100% Pure<CPT14>Botanical Name: Boswellia Serrata<CPT14>Description: The Frankincense tree originates from the Middle East, and is small with abundant pinnacle leaves. The flowers are white or pale pink. Frankincense resin begins as a milky-white sticky liquid that flows from the trunk of the tree when it's cut, healing the wound. The resin is then distilled producing the precious oil.<CPT14>Aromatic Scent: Frankincense Essential Oil has a rich woody, earthy scent with a deeply mysterious nuance.<CPT14>History: Frankincense is widely known since biblical times. Frankincense is from the French word 'Franc' meaning 'luxuriant' or it could be 'real incense'. Also known as Olibanum, Frankincense was used by the ancient Egyptians in their religious ceremonies and was used as incense by the Greeks and the Romans.\n",
