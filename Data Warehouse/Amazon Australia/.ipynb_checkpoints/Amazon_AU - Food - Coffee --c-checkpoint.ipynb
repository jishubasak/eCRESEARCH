Even though a strong coffee there is no bitterness at all.<CPT14>100% ARABICA: All the beans for these blends are 100% Arabica. Oro Arabica consists of beans from Brazil, Kenya and Nicaragua; Altura Blend is a composition of beans from Nicaragua, Ethiopia and Papua New Guinea.<CPT14>FRESHLY ROASTED: Precision roasted in our roasting facility in New South Wales.<CPT14>TASTING NOTES: Oro Arabica - Blackcurrant, Passionfruit, Malt Chocolate, Hazelnut and Cocoa. Nice and Balanced. Altura Blend - Cocoa, Blackcurrant, Toffee, Delicate & Clean<CPT14>BLACK OR WHITE COFFEE: While Oro Arabica does justice to both Black Coffee and With Milk, Altura Blend goes well with the Milk, for those who want a strong early morning dose or during the day to keep them going.\n",

      "AUSTRALIA’S FIRST ORGANIC HEMP COFFEE PRODUCER! Our coffee blends are 100% certified Fairtrade organic. Designed by a coffee professional with over 12 years’ experience and tested for feedback in face-to-face tastings at South Melbourne Market. Everything’s freshly roasted and ground in Melbourne so you know you’re getting the best.<CPT14>SUSTAINABLY-GROWN AUSTRALIAN HEMP. We make sure we only source our hemp seed protein from a reputable supplier in Victoria (Geelong). The hemp is grown in Victoria and Tasmania, and is cold-pressed to make sure all the nutrients and the rich nutty flavour is preserved.<CPT14>SMOOTH & DELICIOUS! The protein in hemp seed rounds off the bitterness found in regular coffees, giving a much smoother overall taste. It’s easy to drink and won’t burn your empty stomach like regular coffee does. Lots of people are surprised to find they don’t need to add sugar or milk because it’s so smooth.<CPT14>FULL OF HEALTH BENEFITS! Each 250g bag contains 46g of protein, 7.75g of omegas 3 & 6, and less than a single gram of natural sugar.<CPT14>WHY HEMP? It’s simple: protein, fibre and omegas! Hemp foods are rich in protein, insoluble dietary fibre and have all the 9 essential amino acids the body needs. They also contain omega-3, omega-6, stearidonic acid (SDA), vitamin D, and the rare omega-6 Gamma Linolenic Acid (GLA).\n",

Even though a strong coffee there is no bitterness at all.<CPT14>100% ARABICA: All the beans for these blends are 100% Arabica. Oro Arabica consists of beans from Brazil, Kenya and Nicaragua; Altura Blend is a composition of beans from Nicaragua, Ethiopia and Papua New Guinea.<CPT14>FRESHLY ROASTED: Precision roasted in our roasting facility in New South Wales.<CPT14>TASTING NOTES: Oro Arabica - Blackcurrant, Passionfruit, Malt Chocolate, Hazelnut and Cocoa.

      "8oz,227g Hacienda Esmeralda Geisha Grounded Coffee Private Collection<CPT14>The top chateaux is this fabulous coffee in their own right, still costly but a relative bargain. Lafite-Rothschild has its Lafite Rothschild Carruades de Lafite; Château Latour its Les Forts de Latour. These wines would be great in anyone's book, but they are withheld, often for a tiny detail, from being in the rarified top lot. The same holds true for Esmeralda Private Collection Geisha. This is a wonderful coffee, exhibiting much of the same lovely jasmine, floral and lemony tones.<CPT14>The competition for the coffee is fierce and prices go very high. This year a new world price record was set for a natural process lot attaining $601 a pound! Without considering this record price most of the auctioned coffee is in the $50 to $200 range and needs to be at least twice that by the time it roasted and sold. Esmeralda can go for $5 to $20 when sold by the cup.<CPT14>Roasting Notes: We artisan roasted Medium light. Why? This will best preserve the delicate Geisha citrus and fruit flavors, which can be masked if dark roasted.\n",

Lafite-Rothschild has its Lafite Rothschild Carruades de Lafite; Château Latour its Les Forts de Latour. These wines would be great in anyone's book, but they are withheld, often for a tiny detail, from being in the rarified top lot. The same holds true for Esmeralda Private Collection Geisha. This is a wonderful coffee, exhibiting much of the same lovely jasmine, floral and lemony tones.<CPT14>The competition for the coffee is fierce and prices go very high. This year a new world price record was set for a natural process lot attaining $601 a pound! Without considering this record price most of the auctioned coffee is in the $50 to $200 range and needs to be at least twice that by the time it roasted and sold. Esmeralda can go for $5 to $20 when sold by the cup.<CPT14>Roasting Notes: We artisan roasted Medium light. Why? This will best preserve the delicate Geisha citrus and fruit flavors, which can be masked if dark roasted.\n",

The roaster sits behind a huge glass window & this is where the art of making coffee takes place.<CPT14>1950''s FLORENCE CAFE SCENE - is where Pip takes you at Hyper Hyper Coffee. Having trained under Barry Constable whose knowledge of authentic espresso roasting originated in Florence during this time. To produce a fine, authentic Italian Espresso it is best achieved by developing flavours inherent in the bean's essential oils, to a point of caramelisation - dangerously close to destruction. It's an art - People don't just love Hyper Hyper Coffee...they can't go anywhere else!<CPT14>\"FIRST SIP, UNBELIEVABLE...THAT IS AN UNDERSTATEMENT! - Best coffee I've ever had\" When you join the crowds waiting for their Hyper Hyper 'fix' the vinyl is always spinning; Led Zeppelin, Bowie, The Rolling Stones. Hyper is the full experience. It's music, its art, it's the smell of roasting beans, It's Pip De Pulford rushing about ensuring everything is perfect, It's Florence, It's the vibe, & its the pure unbridled coffee that is OUT OF THIS WORLD!!<CPT14>HYPER HYPER COFFEE AT YOUR PLACE? - YES! You don't have to drive hours on the weekend to the little piece of Italy on the South Coast of Australia anynore. Wake up to a Hyper Hyper Coffee every day. Thick, creamy, velvety lushness - pure Italian decadence.\n",
