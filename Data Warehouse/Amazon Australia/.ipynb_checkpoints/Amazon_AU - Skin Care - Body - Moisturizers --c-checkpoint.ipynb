      "New and improved for 2020 - Worlds Best Quality - EXCLUSIVE EAST-AFRICAN SHEA: 100% Certified Organic, Non-GMO, Vegan, Gluten Free, and BPA Free! As soon as you touch your 8-oz jar of pure, cold-pressed, unrefined organic shea butter, you’ll know right away by the creamy texture that you’re holding East African shea butter in your hand, not West. Imported straight from a small fair-trade farm in Uganda, our pure unrefined Shea butter has up to 17x the healing power of common West African Shea.<CPT14>EVERYTHING YOUR SKIN DESIRES: With five fatty acids plus vitamins A, E, F and K, our organic raw shea butter is an all-around skin powerhouse. Not only do the oils, vitamins and minerals moisturize your skin, but more olien oil in our nilotica shea butter is far more effective than West African shea from Ghana at protecting your skin. This helps treat conditions like eczema and severe dry skin, while nourishing aged and damaged skin to return that vibrancy you thought was gone for good.<CPT14>FOR HAIR THAT SHINES: Massage our natural, unrefined shea butter into your hair to restore that lost luster and revitalize those depleted ends; it’s great for deep conditioning as well as fortifying natural hair. It also works wonders on your scalp – getting rid of dryness and irritation and working to repair the damage that sun, cold, and chemical styling products can do to this sensitive area.<CPT14>CERTIFIED AND RESPONSIBLY SOURCED FROM UGANDA: Not only is our Eastern African shea butter organic USDA certified, it has also earned fair trade certification from Ecocert, an organization dedicated to ensuring that African farmers and collectors are fairly compensated for their work. Our farm also provides free materials such as sugar, soap and mosquito nets to local farmers as well as healthcare including malaria drugs to the community at large. See our videos below to see the community.<CPT14>TRY IT FOR A MONTH: Whether you apply our organic East African Shea butter directly onto your skin or combine it with other oils to make a super-cream you won’t find in any store, we’re confident you’ll feel the difference immediately, as well as over time. If for any reason you’re not 100% happy with our product, just let us know within 30 days to receive a prompt refund or replacement.

      "✅ GREAT FOR HAIR AND SKIN: Fractionated oil is more saturated and holds a higher concentration of Caprylic acid – an antioxidizing and disinfecting component. It’s perfect as a moisturizer and cleanser for your whole body and is a great makeup remover too! You can also use it on your hair as a night conditioner that you wash off the next day or as a protectant prior to bleaching it.<CPT14>✅ AROMATHERAPY USES: Fractionated coconut oil is perfect for diluting stronger essential oils because it is both odorless and colorless. This makes it ideal for diluting an essential oil while simply softening its specific scent.<CPT14>✅ IDEAL MASSAGE OIL: Aside from being odorless, Fractionated coconut oil is also non-greasy. The stickier consistency makes it suitable for shorter massage strokes, which are used to alleviate muscle tension. It is also less expensive than other massage oils and easily washes out of sheets.<CPT14>✅ PACKAGE INCLUDES: A 16 oz bottle of the purest fractionated coconut oil with a pump for easy and hygienic dispensing.<CPT14>✅ Oraganix is breaking into the beauty industry with pure ingredients, attentive detail, and the ideal of staying true to nature. We want to bring beauty back to the basic, which includes producing only products with healing ingredients found in nature.\n",
