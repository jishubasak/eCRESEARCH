If fact, as it is used on the face, oils will often get grey or black if acids are present in the skin.”<CPT14>\"The heart of the treatment involves vigorously rubbing the soles of the feet with a 3-metal bowl to draw heat and toxins out of the body, thereby inducing tremendous relaxation. In some cases, when more internal heat is released, the soles of the feet can darken from grey to almost black.”<CPT14>“ The gentle friction helps pull acidity out of the tissues (probably a reason why sometimes the oil used will go grey to black).”<CPT14>\"Skin should be thoroughly cleansed before oil is applied and the massage begins.

      "YOU ARE BUYING 1 KANSA WAND IN THE SIZE = SMALL This Kansa is made of seasoned wood and high-quality bronze, an alloy of tin and copper. According to Ayurveda copper benefits the eyes, hair and heart, while tin helps balance digestion and sleep patterns. The wooden handle makes it easy to grip and provides ease of leverage.<CPT14>As per multiple sites on the Internet: \"The Kansa Wand provides gentle friction to facial muscles which helps pull acidity from the tissues. If fact, as it is used on the face, oils will often get grey or black if acids are present in the skin.”<CPT14>\"The heart of the treatment involves vigorously rubbing the soles of the feet with a 3-metal bowl to draw heat and toxins out of the body, thereby inducing tremendous relaxation. In some cases, when more internal heat is released, the soles of the feet can darken from grey to almost black.”<CPT14>“ The gentle friction helps pull acidity out of the tissues (probably a reason why sometimes the oil used will go grey to black).”<CPT14>\"Skin should be thoroughly cleansed before oil is applied and the massage begins. When skin is more acidic, the oil turns grey. This may be a sign of stress or makeup with a poor pH, the result of working around chemicals”\n",

Shilajit resin forms from decayed plant materials over the course of hundreds of years<CPT14>As a result, Shilajit has a host of vitamins, minerals, trace elements along with Humic acid, and Fulvic acid. History of himalayan shilajit --About 50 million years ago, the Indian continent collided into Asia and formed the Himalayan mountain range. As the mountains formed, tropical forests were crushed and compacted between massive boulders.<CPT14>The compressed forests gradually transformed into a nutrient- and mineral-rich biomass loaded with powerful humic and fulvic acids. Now, every summer as the mountains warm, India's most prized herbal remedy literally oozes from these biomass resins in the high mountain crevasses.

Shilajit resin forms from decayed plant materials over the course of hundreds of years<CPT14>As a result, Shilajit has a host of vitamins, minerals, trace elements along with Humic acid, and Fulvic acid. History of himalayan shilajit --About 50 million years ago, the Indian continent collided into Asia and formed the Himalayan mountain range. As the mountains formed, tropical forests were crushed and compacted between massive boulders.<CPT14>The compressed forests gradually transformed into a nutrient- and mineral-rich biomass loaded with powerful humic and fulvic acids. Now, every summer as the mountains warm, India's most prized herbal remedy literally oozes from these biomass resins in the high mountain crevasses.
